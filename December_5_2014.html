		<h1> Friday December 5, 2014 </h1> 
		<p> Questions: 

1a. Friendship/ Interaction with the World:  (Actual question)

// How should I interact with the world? (Question Pastor answered)
James 4: 4
	“To be an enemy with God.” 
Psalm 1:1
Counsel: Influence. 
Proverbs
“Bad company will ruin good habits”
Habits: Convictions, a repeated behavior, pattern your life around it.

Only time to befriend someone is to share the word of God. 

Courtship Evangelism is not talked about in the Bible.


Intentionally looking to be friends with someone(that is ungodly) for the sake of friendship is contrary to the Word of God, but  this doesn’t mean one should not be friendly and still give a good testimony to them. 

We have control of what kind of relationship we attain. 
God knows our heart’s motivations. 

Why did God dine with Sinners?
They wanted to hear what he had to say.  // Someone wanted it, someone had it to give.
Advice: 
If you’re not accepted “Shake the dust from your sandals and leave.” 

Line is passed when you intentionally find reasons to hang out. 
Establish your boundaries:
Say who you are right off the bat. (“I am a Christian.”)
You make it harder on yourself later on if you don’t.

5 relationships types:
Neighbor -superficial, greetings only.
Neighbor ++  : Some engaging conversations .
School/ Work 
Friendship apart from duties
Sharing intimate things from heart (Should be reserved for marriage)
					// cross the line into emotions 
					// becomes attachment

You don’t need to tell someone you can’t be friends
	- Watch what you say
	- Keep barriers: physical, time, and emotional.
	
When you cross the line, you are tied up and miss out on the opportunity to minister in the future.  You need to take a stand in the beginnings of your “relationships” with people. 
					
Avoid saying: “I’m a Christian, I can’t.”  Instead: “I don’t want to go.” If you say “I can’t” they will find every possible way to change your mind, if they know it’s a personal choice, they will keep their distance. 

Family Member?

The same wisdom is applied but it is easier because they should know who you are. 

A friendship with the world must be sought when there is 100% intention to minister, no secret alternatives. 

Pray for God to give you grace and wisdom to be able to deny friendship. Better to offend them than God. 


1b. How does one draw line with worldly friends: (Actual question asked)
	// Draw the line with worldly acquaintances. (Question pastor answered).

Know your line and clear values, otherwise you will have no order of doing things. 
1c. How to interact with friends who want to be friends but are ungodly? 
	Same as above 
1d. Choosing friends outside church. 
 	Same as above



2.  Why do we follow all commandments except keeping the Sabbath

Exodus 31:12
“The Lord spake unto Moses. . .me and YOU” // Convenient between Him and ISREAL 
“soul shall be cut off from you” //  Who? ISREAL
“rest” // physical rest
17 “IT” //  What is “It?” shabbat
		 It is a sign between Israel and God.

Matthew 11:28 
“Come to me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest”
// what kind of labor?  Spriritual

If any many wants to come after me carry your cross DAILY// not just Saturday. 
									// sanctify daily 

“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.” Mark 2:27

“Learn from me for I am weak and lowly .. rest from you SOUL” // spiritual rest



Israel: The Sabbath was for rest for body and mind and engage in the scripture. 
Gentiles: Go to God and He will be our rest, DAILY. 

WHY SUNDAY? 
Most people don’t work, not because it is a special day. 


Courtship Tangent 
How are things going to develop if you marry without a relationship and obedience with God and parents, and responsibility?

Why did God create Adam first and not Eve first?
	When did he create Eve?
		After Adam learned to have a consistent relationship with God, obey God.
		God gave Adam responsibility. 
		
Why is it bad to like girls at a young age? (Actual question asked)
 // Why is it bad to pursue your like and to feed that emotion at a young age?(Question pastor answered).
When you pursue that feeling, it is like feeding wood to the fire. // You loose control of emotions.  
What is young age?  // Out of time, out of season
		
Is it bad to like a boy?
		NO, however if there is no teaching, our feelings will be like water spilling out of a pitcher - uncontrollable, spilling everywhere. Emotions will spill and Devil will take control of emotions. This can happen when:
No Guidance from god’s Word
No Prayer Life
No Parents to guide you

	How are you dealing with feelings? 
		Dangerous to share emotions because they can go anywhere aimlessly.  
		
	Don’ tell them you like them, don’t share personal things.
		// Don’t commit emotionally because there is no certainty of where
		it will lead to. 
		
	Put God on the forefront, not emotions. 
	
God’s counsel will put you in right direction for eternity. 
Have self discipline with emotions. 
In one day you can be attracted to 100 different people, it doesn’t mean that you “like” them. 

This is why marriages fall into adultery due to no containment in emotions. 

Be a good follower: Learn to communicate, learn to listen. 

Three responsibilities of a Young person:
1 Corinthians 7: 
If you’re single, “ serve God with out distraction” // like he is your husband.
	- #1 distraction is relationship pursuit // “Time and season for everything.”
						    // Thorns Jeremiah 3: “Don’t plant in thorns”
Pleasing focus shifts
Person becomes blind to consequences
Matthew 6:33 // God knows it’s not good for man to be alone. 
		// He will provide on His time. 
		// “I honor those who honor me.” 

Don’t do it out of season, out of time and in hiding or else it becomes fatal to spiritual walk.
Jeremiah 17:9 “Who can trust it?” // heart is seed of emotion


 Honor your father and mother 
Honor: acknowledge; 
“This is a commandment with promise.”

If you don’t put God first and relationship with parents, any other relationship will be dysfunctional. 

Fire of God is constructive.
Fire of flesh is destructive.

Responsible 
	Student
	Duties at home which do two things: 1. Responsible as a person & family unit 
	2. Learn to be a giver and not a taker (Don’t be a consumer, but a contributor).
		- People will get tired of you if you only contribute instead of consume. 


“Word is a light unto my feet and a light unto my path”
	- Living without direction is like going to a foreign country without a map
With out direction, frustration occurs, then discouragement, then one gives up.


95% of people do it opposite to God’s word.
God brings to nothing your plans if you do it without putting him first. 
You will suffer results of your own disobedience.
