		<p> Questions: <br/>

<b>1a. Friendship/ Interaction with the World:  (Actual question)<br/ >

// How should I interact with the world? (Question Pastor answered)</b><br/ >
James 4: 4<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">&quot;To be an enemy with God.&quot; <br/ >
Psalm 1:1<br/ >
<b>Counsel:</b> Influence. <br/ >
Proverbs<br/ >
&quot;Bad company will ruin good habits&quot;<br/ >
<b>Habits:</b> Convictions, a repeated behavior, pattern your life around it.<br/ >
</p>

<p>
Only time to befriend someone is to share the word of God. <br/ >
<br/>
Courtship Evangelism is not talked about in the Bible.<br/ >
<br/>
<br/>
Intentionally looking to be friends with someone(that is ungodly) for the sake of friendship is contrary to the Word of God,<br/>
but  this does not mean one should not be friendly and still give a good testimony to them. <br/ >
<br/>
We have control of what kind of relationship we attain. <br/ >
God knows our heart&apos;s motivations. <br/ >
<br>/
<b>Why did God dine with Sinners?</b><br/ >
They wanted to hear what he had to say.  // Someone wanted it, someone had it to give.<br/ >
<b>Advice:</b> 
If you are not accepted &quot;Shake the dust from your sandals and leave.&quot; <br/ >
<br/>
<b>>>Line is passed when you intentionally find reasons to hang out.<<</b> <br/ >
Establish your boundaries:<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Say who you are right off the bat. (&quot;I am a Christian.&quot;)<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">You make it harder on yourself later on if you do not.<br/ ></p>

<b>5 relationships types:</b><br/ >
- Neighbor -superficial, greetings only.<br/ >
- Neighbor ++  : Some engaging conversations .<br/ >
- School/ Work <br/ >
- Friendship apart from duties<br/ >
- Sharing intimate things from heart (Should be reserved for marriage)<br/ >
	<p style="text-indent: 2em;">// cross the line into emotions <br/ ></p>
	<p style="text-indent: 2em;">// becomes attachment<br/ ></p>
<br/>
You do not need to tell someone you can not be friends<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- Watch what you say<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- Keep barriers: physical, time, and emotional.<br/ ></p>
<br/>
When you cross the line, you are tied up and miss out on the opportunity to minister in the future.  You need to take a stand in the beginnings of your &quot;relationships&quot; with people. <br/ >
<br/>				
Avoid saying: &quot;I am a Christian, I can not.&quot;  Instead: &quot;I do not want to go.&quot; If you say &quot;I ca not&quot; they will find every possible way to change your mind, if they know it is a personal choice, they will keep their distance. <br/ >
<br/>
Family Member?<br/ >
<br/>
The same wisdom is applied but it is easier because they should know who you are. <br/ >
<br/>
A friendship with the world must be sought when there is 100% intention to minister, no secret alternatives. <br/ >
<br/>
Pray for God to give you grace and wisdom to be able to deny friendship. Better to offend them than God. <br/ >
<br/>

<b>1b. How does one draw line with worldly friends: (Actual question asked)</b><br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">// Draw the line with worldly acquaintances. (Question pastor answered).<br/ ></p>
<br>
Know your line and clear values, otherwise you will have no order of doing things. <br/ >
<b>1c. How to interact with friends who want to be friends but are ungodly? <br/ ></b>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Same as above <br/ ></p>
<b>1d. Choosing friends outside church. <br/ ></b>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Same as above<br/ ></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>2.  Why do we follow all commandments except keeping the Sabbath<br/ ></b>
<br/>
Exodus 31:12<br/ >
&quot;The Lord spake unto Mose...me and YOU&quot; // Convenient between Him and ISREAL <br/ >
&quot;soul shall be cut off from you&quot; //  Who? ISREAL<br/ >
&quot;rest&quot; // physical rest<br/ >
17 &quot;IT&quot; //  What is &quot;It?&quot; shabbat<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> It is a sign between Israel and God.<br/ ></p>
<br/>
Matthew 11:28 <br/ >
&quot;Come to me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest&quot;<br/ >
// what kind of labor?  Spiritual<br/ >
<br/>
If any many wants to come after me carry your cross DAILY// not just Saturday. <br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">							// sanctify daily <br/ ></p>
<br/>
&quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.&quot; Mark 2:27<br/ >
<br/>
&quot;Learn from me for I am weak and lowly .. rest from you SOUL&quot; // spiritual rest<br/ >
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Israel: The Sabbath was for rest for body and mind and engage in the scripture. <br/ >
Gentiles: Go to God and He will be our rest, DAILY. <br/ >
<br/>
WHY SUNDAY? <br/ >
Most people do not work, not because it is a special day. <br/ >
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Courtship Tangent <br/ ></b>
How are things going to develop if you marry without a relationship and obedience with God and parents, and responsibility?<br/ >
<br/>
Why did God create Adam first and not Eve first?<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">When did he create Eve?<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em;">After Adam learned to have a consistent relationship with God, obey God.<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 3em;">God gave Adam responsibility. <br/ >
<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.Why is it bad to like girls at a young age? (Actual question asked)<br/ >
 // Why is it bad to pursue your like and to feed that emotion at a young age?(Question pastor answered).<br/ ></b>
When you pursue that feeling, it is like feeding wood to the fire. // You loose control of emotions.  <br/ >
What is young age?  // Out of time, out of season<br/ >
<br/>	
Is it bad to like a boy?<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> NO, however if there is no teaching, our feelings will be like water spilling out of a pitcher - uncontrollable, spilling everywhere.<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Emotions will spill and Devil will take control of emotions. This can happen when:<br/ ></p>
No Guidance from God&apos;s Word<br/ >
No Prayer Life<br/ >
No Parents to guide you<br/ >
<br/>
How are you dealing with feelings? <br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Dangerous to share emotions because they can go anywhere aimlessly. <br/ > </p>		
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Do not tell them you like them, do not share personal things.<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Do notcommit emotionally because there is no certainty of where<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">it will lead to. <br/ ></p>	
Put God on the forefront, not emotions.<br/ > 
<br/>	
God&apos;s counsel will put you in right direction for eternity. <br/ >
Have self discipline with emotions. <br/ >
In one day you can be attracted to 100 different people, it doesn&apos;t mean that you &quot;like&quot; them. <br/ >
<br/>
This is why marriages fall into adultery due to no containment in emotions. <br/ >
<br/>
Be a good follower: Learn to communicate, learn to listen. <br/ >
<br/>
<b>Three responsibilities of a young person:<br/ ></b>
1 Corinthians 7: <br/ >
<b>1. If you are single, &quot; serve God with out distraction&quot;// like he is your husband.<br/ ></b>
- #1 distraction is relationship pursuit // &quot;Time and season for everything.&quot;<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> // Thorns Jeremiah 3: &quot;Do not plant in thorns&quot;<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">// Handle important areas, in other words, before entering into a relationship. <br/></p>
Pleasing focus shifts<br/ >
Person becomes blind to consequences<br/ >
Matthew 6:33 // God knows itâ€™s not good for man to be alone. <br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">// He will provide on His time. <br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">// &quot;I honor those who honor me.&quot; <br/ ></p>
<br/>
Don&apos;t do it out of season, out of time and in hiding or else it becomes fatal to spiritual walk.<br/ >
Jeremiah 17:9 &quot;Who can trust it?&quot; // heart is seed of emotion<br/ >
<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Honor your father and mother <br/ ></b>
<b>Honor:</b> acknowledge; <br/ >
&quot;This is a commandment with promise.&quot;<br/ >
<br/>
If you do not put God first and relationship with parents, any other relationship will be dysfunctional. <br/ >
<br/>
Fire of God is constructive.<br/ >
Fire of flesh is destructive.<br/ >
<br/>
<b>3.Responsible <br/ ></b>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	Student<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	Duties at home which do two things: </p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em;">   1. Responsible as a person & family unit <br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em;">	2. Learn to be a giver and not a taker (Do not be a consumer, but a contributor).<br/ ></p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">	 People will get tired of you if you only contribute instead of consume. <br/ ></p>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Word is a light unto my feet and a light unto my path&quot;<br/ >
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">- Living without direction is like going to a foreign country without a map<br/ ></p>
With out direction, frustration occurs, then discouragement, then one gives up.<br/ >
<br/>
<br>
<b>95% of people do it opposite to God&apos;s word.<br/ ></b>
God brings to nothing your plans if you do it without putting him first. <br/ >
You will suffer results of your own disobedience. <br/ >
