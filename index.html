		<h1> Women Of God </h1> 
		<p> Would you like to optimize your walk as a Woman of God but are unclear of how to go about starting? Maybe you don't have a clear picture of <br />
			what it looks like or means to be a woman of God. Perhaps you don't how to tell if you are on the right track or not. If this is you, welcome <br />
			to a 20 week discussion to what you want - How to be a woman of God.<br />
			</p>
			
		<p>	Pastor Efraim Valverd III has set up a 20 week series to address anonymous concerns from both young men and women from the congregation. <br />
			He is targeting 8 main areas of a young person’s life: Child of God, son/daughter, employee, business owner, future husband/ wife, student, <br />
			courtship,  and as a citizen. He wishes to address these concerns with Biblical insight over the course of 20 weeks during youth nights. <br />
			Each gender group will be separated to discuss these sets of concerns. The plan is to meet three times a week at church and to have one week away<br /> 
			from youth night and have a family Bible study. <br />
		</p>
		
		<p>	We will piece together what characterizes a man and woman of God. These studies will provide you with a vision and goal and allow you to see <br />
			if you’re heading in the right direction of where you say want to go. <br />
		</p>
		

		<p>	Pastor Efraim has reminded us of the following: God’s instruction is a blessing from God, rejecting it is rejecting life and peace of God in our lives. <br />
			Imagine if you will a man who is given a check for a lump sum of a million dollas and emphatically rejects it with offense that is was given <br />
			to him in the first place. That is what we resemble when we reject God's will for our lives. <br />
			Don’t trade what has a predictable end (a promised blessing) to one that has an unpredictable end. <br />
		</p>

		<p> Does a tree get roots over night?<br />
			No, it takes care, time and so will our roots of faith as Women of God. <br />
