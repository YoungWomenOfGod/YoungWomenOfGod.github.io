		<h1> Women Of God </h1> 
		<p> 
		
			Would you like to optimize your walk as a Woman of God but are unclear of how to go about starting? Maybe you don't have a clear picture of
			what it looks like or means to be a woman of God. Perhaps you don't how to tell if you are on the right track or not. If this is you, welcome 
			to a 20 week discussion to what you want - How to be a woman of God.
			
			Pastor Efraim Valverd III has set up a 20 week series to address anonymous concerns from both young men and women from the congregation. 
			He is targeting 8 main areas of a young person’s life: Child of God, son/daughter, employee, business owner, future husband/ wife, student, 
			courtship,  and as a citizen. He wishes to address these concerns with Biblical insight over the course of 20 weeks during youth nights. 
			Each gender group will be separated to discuss these sets of concerns. The plan is to meet three times a week at church and to have one week away 
			from youth night and have a family Bible study. 
		
			We will piece together what characterizes a man and woman of God. These studies will provide you with a vision and goal and allow you to see
			if you’re heading in the right direction of where you say want to go.

			Pastor Efraim has reminded us of the following: God’s instruction is a blessing from God, rejecting it is rejecting life and peace of God in our lives.
			Imagine if you will a man who is given a check for a lump sum of a million dollas and emphatically rejects it with offense that is was given 
			to him in the first place. That is what we resemble when we reject God's will for our lives. 
			Don’t trade what has a predictable end (a promised blessing) to one that has an unpredictable end. 

			Does a tree get roots over night?
			No, it takes care, time and so will our roots of faith as Women of God.
