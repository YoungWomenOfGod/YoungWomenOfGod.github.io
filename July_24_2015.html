		Have you ever imagine your life on fire for God? <br>
		<br>
		What happens if we have poor morals and characteristics? Can we <br>
		please God?<br>
		<br>
		How many need God to place in us new morals and characteristics? <br>
		<br>
		But what does that mean? <br>
		<br>
		Do we let God's Spirit through prayer and fasting work through us to <br>
		become a man or woman of God? <br>
		<br>
		<b>Lukewarmness theory</b> <br>
		Someone once said that if they were born into a family that was<br>
		luke warm that the next generation would be warm, <br>
		then the next generation would be hot, <br>
		then the next generation would be on fire, <br>
		then the next generation would be nuclear. <br>
		<br>
		When in reality the opposite was true. <br>
		If their family was lukewarm, then the next generation would be cool, <br>
		then the next generation would be cold, <br>
		then the next generation would be frozen. <br>
		<br>
		The only one who can break these cycels of poor habits is the Lord's Spirit. <br>
		<br>
		We need to be broken and HE is the only one that can break our genertational <br>
		cycles. <br>
		<br>
		The Word of God is more than just black and white text: it is Spirit and it <br>
		is Truth. How many of us need His Spirirt and truth?<br>

		What God spoke in Galatians (Fruit of the Spirirt) is seen throught the entire <br>
		Bible; in the new and first testement. <br>
		<br>
		David was after God's own heart means that he wanted God's every desire. <br>
		<br>
		When we read God's word, it screams change. <br>
		<br>
		If you lack anything regarding the Word of God: "Demand it from God" (James)<br>
		<br>
		Galatians 5:22 "But the fruit of the Spirirt is love, joy, . . . against such <br>things there is no law. . . if we live in the Spirit let us live in the Spirit. "<br>

		<b>JOY:</b> "Count it ALL as Joy. " <br>
		Not talking about 'happiness.'<br>
		<b>PEACE:</b> "Peace I leave you, not as the world does. "<br>
		<b>LONGSUFFERING:</b> "Some people call it as late, but it's God's longsuffering<br>
		(patience) for us to turn to him."<br>
		<b>GENTLENESS:</b>Peter and Paul's brutness was changed. <br>
		<b>GOODNESS:</b> King David showed this during his reign; Looking for the <br>
		well being of others. <br>
		<b>FAITH:</b> "Blessed are those who have not yet seen, but believe."  <br>
				"Seeing the heavenly city.. " (Hebrews 11)<br>
				"Faith comes from hearing the Word of God."<br>
		<b>MEEKNESS:</b> Realizing the power God has given us and still humbling ourselves. <br>
		It comes from realizing God has trusted us with this message to be delivered <br>
		meekly. You don't take any of the glory. <br>
		<b>TEMPERANCE:</b> Our reactions to people. How do you respond to others, how <br>
		is your wording? Only God's spirirt can give you dominion over your ownselves.<br>
		God's control over your 'self.'<br>
		<br>
		100 % of your problems are resolved through the Spirit of God. <br>
		When the Spirit of God is taken away, there is turmoil. <br>
		Therefore all problems can be faced with the Spirit of God. <br>
