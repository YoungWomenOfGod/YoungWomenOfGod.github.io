		<br> Concern</b> <br>
		Serving God and not falling away. <br>
		<br>
		1. Grow up, regardless of age. May sound rough, but it is<br>
		Biblical. "When I was a child, I behaved as a child. . " <br>
		<br>
		Our characteristics make or break us; our fruit. <br>
		<br>
		"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, <br>
		ye have need that one teach you again which be the first <br>
		principles of the orcacles of God; and are become such as have <br>
		need of milk, and not of strong meat." Hebrews 5:12  <br>
		<br>
		Someone once asked: <br>
		"Why is it that I don't want to hear when people talk to <br>
		me about the word of God: I already know."<br>
		<br>
		"Correct the fool and they will not listen. But correct <br>
		the wise, and you gave him more knowledge." Proverbs <br>
		<br>
		There comes a point in time when we realize our need for God<br>
		<br>
		For the time ye ought to be teachers // We shouldn't have to tell you <br>
		things that you should know already; We should be teachers at our level. <br> 
		<br>
		"Be doers and not hearers." This happens when God's word is in our heart. <br>
		<br>
		"Search me, Lord." The only one who can change us is God, so why shouldn't we let Him search us?<br>
		<br>
		"and are become such as have need of milk, // Milk refers to the food that children eat.<br>
		and not of strong meat."  // Refers to food for the mature. <br>
		<br>
		"What good is it to be nice to those that are nice to you? Even sinners do that"<br> 
		The characteristics of good are to show up even when we don't feel like it. <br> 
		<br>
		Hebrews 5:14 "But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who<br>
		reason of use have their senses excercised to discern both good and evil." <br>
		// Having their senses exercised means to get in shape spiritually. <br>
		<br>
		1 Corinthians 16:13, 14<br>
		"Watch ye and stand fast in the faith, quit(behave) ye like men(women), be strong."<br>
		//What kind of man/woman? (In later verses)<br>
		"Let all your things be done in love. " <br> 
		<br> A mature spiritual man and woman will love<br>
		<br>
		What do I fight with the most; what keeps me from doing the things of God? <br>
		You never know when someone is either watching you or needs to be ministered to. <br>
		<br>
		When you are growing up spiritualy, God will implore His Spirit in you. <br>
		<br>

		--------------- Bro. Saturn <br>
		You're always learning no matter where you are. <br>
		In our walk with God we will have to adjust regularly. <br>
		Anywhere that God puts us in, we are to adjust, to grow in <br>
		whichever circumstance we are in. <br>
		<br>
		Hebrews 6:1 <br>
		"Therefore leaving the elementary teachings of God and let <br>
		us press on toward maturity(perfectiong) " <br> 
		<br>
		Grow hurts, just as getiing fit hurts too. <br> 
		<br>
		Hebrews 11:1-6<br>
		"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence  of things not seen.<br>
		For by it the elders obtained a good report....For without faith it is <br>
		impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,<br>
		and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. " <br>
