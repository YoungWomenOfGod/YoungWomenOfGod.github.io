Bro. Johnny<br>
<br>
How do we react to life lessons, how do we dress, how to obey the word of God, what is our doctrine, <br>
how do we prepare for our future?<br>
<br>
James "If you are tempted, you can NOT be tempted by God, because he does not tempt anyone, our <br>
own lusts are the only ones who tempt us."<br>
<br>
Our desires that we have change us, they form us. <br>
<br>
Anecdote: <br>
A young lady grew up in church, never wanted to do anything wrong,she wanted to stay out of detention, <br>
make right decisions, etc. She was the "perfect" Christian and sadly wound up pregnant when she was<br>
starting to go to college. <br>
<br>
Guy interviewing her: "What made you mess up?"<br>
<br>
Young Lady: "I don't blame God, it was my own disconnection with the Lord, I left the door open to the world." (roughly)<br>
<br>
<br>
When we let the devil in is when we mess up; when we let various lusts(people, things, etc.) consume us. <br>
<br>
"If you think yourself as confident, be careful lest ye fall."  [BIBLE VERSE]<br>
<br>
The minute you let the enemy in (even slightly), he opens it up right up with things that shouldn't be in our mind.<br>
When we don't have the mentality(same mind) as the Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
<br>
We could be focusing on one area, but neglecting all other areas. When we focus on one area to perfection, <br>
we discover all other areas are in shambles. We end up failing and justify and say "next time we will do it."<br>
<br>
"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out..." [BIBLE VERSE] // pluck out that lust, that is causing us to do. <br>
<br>
Now a days we are consumed with technology. From checking out phones frequently for text messages, <br>
social media, etc. that we loose time seeing if we have any updates. <br>
-- If this is you, it needs to stop. <br>
<br>
<br>
----------<br>
How to obey the word of God?<br>
(Bro Phillip's explanation) <br>
Jewish thought: Obey first, question later. <br>
<br>
-- Knowledge comes from the word of God. // You won't know it, unless you read it. <br>
<br><b>
1. Read the Word of God<br>
2. Fear the Lord<br>
3. Deny ourselves <br>
</b>
<br>
ex. Abraham followed exact orders, immediately. <br>
ex. When the Lord came, one of his disciples said, "Let me bury my father." The Lord said,<br>
 "Let the dead bury the dead." Matthew 8:22 <br>
<br>
Listening to the Word of God, goes against everything we think we should do. <br>
<br>
We are all okay with revelations, but the minute someone corrects our lifestyle, offense if formed,<br>
immediately. The flesh that wars continuously in us. Romans 7:23<br>
<br>
It's HARD to obey God, not easy. <br>
<br>
Daniel prayed three times a day because he was an understanding person. <br>
<br>
What does it mean to be an understanding person?<br>
-- Man/woman of prayer, man/woman that reads the word<br>
-- If we don't have a tender heart and do not have an understanding, we won't be able to obey God. <br>
<br>
Obeying the word of God is denying everything that is you and obeying the Word of God. When you<br>
 get to the point where you can deny yourself, forgetting vanity, anything that has to do with this <br>
 world, it will be apparent to others. <br>
<br>
What does it mean to deny yourself? // we can say the right things, but until we actually do, we'll understand it. <br>
<br>
How do we get from "I have to do it" to "I want to do it, this is who I am, this is me denying what I want and giving to others"?<br>
-- Analyze what God has given you then give what you have been given. <br>
   -- "If you do it to the least of these, you do it to me." 
   <br>
Ex.<br>
1. Doing something for someone else that needs it. <br>
2. What will you do with bonuses? <br>
3. Someone comes over and brings dinner that I already cooked, give it to someone else instead. <br>
<br>
Various artists started their singing careers in the church and branched out into the world. <br>
<br>
If we don't deny ourselves in our talents to give to others, we become arrogant. <br>
<br>
<br>
Why is it important to follow God?<br>
<br>
What do you have on your mind? If you don't believe that it is important, then it won't stick. <br>
If you won't have the word of God, this world will suck you up and bring spiritual death. <br>
   - What good is it to die physically if you're already dead?<br>
   - What is there in this world to live for?<br>
<br>
If he is your daily bread, if his Spirit is in my, we shouldn't have this question. <br>
<br>
Hebrews "He hardened heart for a purpose?" // To display God's power. <br>
    - Did abraham question God? Did Jacob question God?<br>
    - Moses questioned Him. <br>
<br>
If God is not your source, if he is not showing his glory in your life, then it is apparent. <br>
<br>
"It is terrible to fall into the hands of a living God." Hebrews 10:31<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
Bro. Saturn <br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2:14,15 "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the sprit. . ." <br>
Hebrews 11:6 "but without God it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to<br>
God must believe that he is a rewarder or them who diligently please him." <br>
<br>
How do I speak to people about the word of God?<br>
-- When you have a passion for God, it will ooze out of you. <br>
