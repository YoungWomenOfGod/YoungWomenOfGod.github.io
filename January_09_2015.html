Wisdom: Knowledge<br>
Understanding: The application of knowledge.<br>
<br>
First reaction to something dictates if one has understanding or not. <br>
<br>
<h2>Question: Is it "bad" to watch movies?<br></h2>
<br>
Genesis 6:5 " And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,<br>
 and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."<br>
What is a movie? <br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> - An imagination of someone's mind, sometime not based on reality. <br> </p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> - Ex. A movie will not always portray historically accurate
 information, rather the movie director's imagination. <br></p>
<br>
Why did God destroy the world with a flood? <br>
Because of the wickedness of the imagination <br>
<br>
Matthew 24:37 "But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."<br>
What were the days of Noah like? <br>
-  "earth was filled with violence."  Genesis 6:13<br>
-  Sodom and Gomorrha had given itself over to "fornication and strange flesh". Jude 1:7<br>
<br>
If imaginations were wicked in the days of Noah, and they are supposed to be amplified <br>
today, what does that say people's imagination are like? Do you think today's director's imaginations<br>
are any better than the people of Noah's days?<br>
<br>
What happens to what you see and hear?<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- Your mind and heart are affected<br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- The more you watch it, the more your mind and heart become synced.  <br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- Whatever we insert into our mind, will dictate the output and thoughts. <br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">		- Ex.(Brother Johnny's personal anecdote)  "When I smell Palm trees,<br>
 I remember my childhood, that's all I remember."<br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 6em;">			- What he experienced stuck with him. 
Jeremiah 17:9 "The heart is deceitful above all things, who can trust it?" <br> 
Many of these movies are inspired by what (imaginations) they have in their heart. <br>
<br>
Matthew 15:19 "For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,<br> 
thefts, false witness, blasphemies:" <br>
<br>
<b>We wrestle against what?<br></b>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against <br>
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against<br>
 spiritual wickedness in high places." - Ephesians 6:12 <br></p>
</b>Who is the God of this world?<br></b>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	"Satan"<br></p>
<b>When you go into the movies, who's world are you in?<br></b>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	"Satan's"<br></p>
The only security is among the brethren.<br> 
	
	
Statistics: (Citation to come)
Europeans mock American's because the woman wants a chick-flick wedding but in reality, it is not so.  <br>
Reports say this false sense of reality causes a marriage to crash, because Hollywood's portrayal is not accurate. <br>
When expectations fall, people tend to get disappointed and handle them differently. <br>
<br>
<br>
"People say people's mind is like a world, and I go on to say that people's mind is like a universe." - Pastor E. V. III<br>
<br>
"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of<br>
 the mouth(your reaction), this defileth a man." Matthew 15:11<br>
<br>
How do you have the mind of Christ?<br>
Not only obey God's word(exterior), but FEEL it; have the spirit (the interior)<br>
<br>
<br>
What is discipline: <br>
- A good thing because without it, we do not know what is good or bad. <br>
- Two types: before and after<br>
<br>
<br>
Once we see it, do it, experience it, we do not want to stop doing it. <br>
- Discipline helps us overcome our emotions <br>
-  It teaches you when to be sensitive to the Spirit  of God and let it control you. <br>
<br> 
If Matthew 15:19 says, "For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,<br>
 fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:" <br>
	- Sounds like a movie review. <br>
<br>
Psalms 1:1 " Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth<br>
 in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." <br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- People who walk into theaters carry certain spirits<br> 
and it is best to avoid interaction as much as possible. <br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> 	- Be wise where you take your eyes and feet. <br> </p>
"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are<br>
 ravening wolves." Matthew 7:15<br>
<br>


<b>How do you win someone over?<br>
Being a child of God. 	<br></b>
<br>
<h2>Question 2: What does it mean to be a child of God?<br></h2>
There are many interpretations of what it means to be a child of God, so many religions,<br>
 and false teachings. <br>
Impossible to be a doer, if you don't know what to do. <br>
<br>
Philippians 4:2 "Be in this same spirit (mind, feel)"<br>
<br>
Analogy: In this world we see many people train to do everything they can do to be a competitive athlete.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> What defines a person is what they show us. <br></p>
	<br>

>> Have Authority <br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">"Paul we know, the Lord Jesus Christ we know, who are you?" - Acts 19:12-16 </p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">The devil KNOWS who the child of God is. <br></p>
<br>
<b>Did God bless the Pharisees and Sadducees? </b>
-John called them "Vipers"
- Romans 2:28-29
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- Circumcision of the heart // Inward, not exterior <br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	- Circumcision is cutting skin, to apply it to our heart, we need to cut out <br>
that which will not let us be humble. <br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	Matthew 6: "Raise their voices so everyone could see that they were holy."<br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 4em;">    - Is it the inside(the spirit, the feel) or the outside that matters as a child of God?</p>
>> Life style, fruitful(characteristics)<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	"Fruit of the spirit" // Doesn't say fruit(s). </p><br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">- Phillipians 2:1-4 <br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">- Galatians 5:23-25<br></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">- 1 Corinthians 2 <br></p>
>> We are made in the image of God, his representative; a 'god' ("Doesn't David say ye are like gods? "<br>
 Psalms 82:6 and John 10:34)<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> When the Lord tells Moses "You will be like a god unto Pharaoh<br>
 and your brother like a prophet." Exodus 7:1 <br>
>> Brotherly Love, that inwardly love, that humble, godly, lowly spirit. <br> 
<br>
Nutshell: It is what is on the inside over what is on the outside. <br>
