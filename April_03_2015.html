			Bro. Saturn -------------<br>
			<br>
			Question: How do we attain God's calling for our life?<br>
			<br>
			<u><b>Phillipians 3:7-14</b></u><br>
			7 But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 8 What is more, <br>
			I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,<br>
			 for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 9 and be <br>
			 found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is<br>
			  through faith in[a] Christ-the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. <br>
			<br>
			10 I want to know Christ-yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his <br>
			sufferings, becoming like him in his death, <br>
			+(10) His death was the price he paid for our calling to be like him. <br>
			<br>
			11 and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. 12 Not that I have already <br>
			obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that <br>
			for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 13 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet <br>
			to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,<br>
			<br>
			14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.<br>
			+(14) "heavenward," or "high calling" // Something that has excellence. <br>
			<br>
			<u><b>1 Timothy 1:7-9</b></u><br>
			7 For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.<br>
			 8 So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with <br>
			 me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. <br>
			9 He has saved us and called us to a holy life-not because of anything we have done but because <br>
			of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,<br>
			+(9) Living a holy life means living a seperate life; set apart. <br>
			<br>
			Our calling is a call to faith.<br>
			<br>
			<b> <u>Hebrews 3:1 </u></b><br>
			1. Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts<br>
			on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.<br>
			+(1) Heavenly calling = high calling. <br>
			<br>
			<b><u>Proverbs 8:32 </u></b><br>
			* Repetition in the Bible is something <br>
			to pay close attention to. Note the word, "Hear"<br>
			in the following portion. <br>
			<br>
			32 "Now then, my children, listen to me; <br>
			// "Hearken"(KJV) <br>
			// Heark = Pay close attention to.<br>
			// -en = turn back to an earlier state; return back.<br>
    			blessed are those who keep my ways.<br>
			33 Listen to my instruction and be wise;<br>
			// "Hear" (KJV)<br>
   				 do not disregard it.<br>
			34 Blessed are those who listen to me,<br>
			// "Heareth me" (KJV)<br>
    			watching daily at my doors,<br>
    			waiting at my doorway.<br>
    		+(34) Waiting with anticipation.<br>
			35 For those who find me find life<br>
    			and receive favor(approval) from the Lord.<br>
    		+(35) We are not truly living unless we have found<br>
    		God and are living in Him. <br>
			36 But those who fail to find me harm themselves;<br>
    			all who hate me love death.‚Äù<br>
    		+(36) Those who fail to find God or sin against God <br>
    		defraud themselves. <br>
    		<br>
    		<b>//Listening to the Call </b><br>
    		<br>
    		What does it mean when many are called but few are chosen? <br>
    		Imagine multiple phones ringing, but only a few answer the call. <br> 
    		Christ is reaching out to many, but only a few respond to their high calling.<br>
    		<br>
    		<b><u>Colossians 3:8-14</u></b><br>
    		 8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, <br>
    		 malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to each other, <br>
    		 since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self, <br>
    		 which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 11 Here there is no <br>
    		 Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but  <br>
    		 Christ is all, and is in all.<br>
    		 <br>
			12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves <br>
			with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13 Bear with each <br>
			other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. <br>
			Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 14 And over all these virtues put on love, <br>
			which binds them all together in perfect unity.<br>
			<br>
			<b><u>1 Corinthians 13:13 </u></b><br>
			13. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.<br>
			+(13) Love is the bond(glue) that brings perfection, or completness. <br>
			<br>
