			Baptism -- "The one who comes after me. . " <br>

			The message of the Lord is that it is not us, it is the power through us. <br>

			We have power in the Spirit promised to us.<br>

			Power not to heal, etc. but Power to pick OUR lives up. To get us up in <br>
			the morning. The power in the Spirit is for us first. When it is un abundently,<br>
			it will naturally overflow into others. <br>

			As the Body of Christ, miricales will happen. <br>

			How can I be filled with the Spirit, for it to be poured over into others. <br> 

			Matthew 28:18 "And Jesus came and spake unto me and all power is . . . " <br>
			Mark 16:15-18 "Go all over the world. . " <br>
			Luke 24:46-50 "ANd he said to them this it is risen. .  ." <br>
			John 3:5 "Jesus answered and said unto them. . ." <br>

			<b>Characteristics, Virtues that a child of God should have. </b> <br>
			>> Peace <br> 
			Is there false Peace? <br>
			Two different types of peace <br> 
	
			Are we able to have peace on our own? <br>

			What kind of Peace? Where does it come from? <br>
			Phillipians 4:6-7 " "<br>

			John 16:33 "These things I have spoken unto you that in me, ye shall have Peace. In this world . . ." <br> 
			He mentions tribulation right after peace.

			John 14:27 " "<br>

			Jerimiah 8:11 " " <br>

			As a child of God, our mannerisms should not be circumstantial. <br>
			We need to fight in our minds consistantly, the mind is where the battle lies.  <br> 

			"He who lacks, demand it from God. . " <br>
			Demand means: I need it right now. <br>

			Abigal and Nebal 1 Samuel 25 <br> 
			Abigal demonstrated peace when she interceeded. Her and her husband where going to be destroyed. <br>
			
			Proverbs 31:36 "She speaks words of kindness. " <br>
			Kindness comes from having peace. <br> 

			"Don't give me less lest I curse you, " <br> 
			He wanted to be at peace with God. It doesn't matter if you <br>
			are at peace with others as long as you are at peace with God. <br>

			As a child of God, you will probably step on some toes. But if God's joy and peace <br>
			are established, it will not go wrong. <br>

			Romans 12:14- " Bless them that persecute you, . . .vengence is mine I will repay, <br> 
			sayeth the Lord. .. be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good. " <br>
			If they are doing it because they hate God, we need to take it. <br> 

			When it is concerning the word of God, and it is not being interpretated correted, we<br>
			need to speak righteousely. Do not say "I think" instead say "Listen, this is what the word of God says. . " <br> 

			Dont premedicate what you will say. If God's spirit is in you, he will show you what to say. God will speak through you. <br>

			When it is concerning behavior, Fless. When there is trouble, flee. When there is lust, flee. <br>

			Through the spirit of God, God will help us in our relationships. <br>
			If you learn to Love the Lord with everything, the realtionships around you will be affected. <br>
