		<b><h3>Being meek is being filled with the Spirit of God.<br></b></h3>
	 	As we saw theapostoles being sent out to do the work of God, "Healing, etc. "<br>
	 	John 10, they were being related to Lamb, <br>
		meaning that they were helpless. They had to rely on the Spirit of God; they needed<br>
		to trust God to execute the duties they hadbeen given because they would otherwise<br>
		not have the resources to do so.  <br>
		<br>
		"Without me, you can do nothing. " <br>
		<br>
		When we have trust, we can say "I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST "<br>
		<br>
		"I have become a servant unto all. " - Paul the Apostle <br>
		<br>
		We need to understand that we are serving God first and formost. We need to trust <br>
		God that we will pour out his Power. It is NOT about haveing a title, only trusting<br>
		God with meekness that he will use you. <br>
		<br>
		<h3>Things we need to do to show God that we are here so we can also say<br>
		 "Here I am Lord," as Jerimiah did.</h3> <br>
		<br>
		1. "Think of ourself as lower " Trust God that God will make a way with your enemies. <br>
		<br>
		2. Evaluate yourself daily <br>
		If you don't have a self evaluation daily, you will not grow spiritually. <br>

		HOW MANY SHARE SCRIPTURES THAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THAT GOD SHARES WITH YOU?<br>
		HOW MANY DO IT HERE (At your church)?<br>
