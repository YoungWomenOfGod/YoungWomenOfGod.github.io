<br>
<b>Psalm 84<br></b>
For the choir director: A psalm of the descendants <br>
of Korah, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.<br>
<br>
1 How lovely is your dwelling place,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    O Lord of Heaven's Armies.</p>
2 I long, yes, I faint with longing<br>
 <p style="text-indent: 2em;">   to enter the courts of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">	With my whole being, body and soul,</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    I will shout joyfully to the living God.</p>
<br>
// How often do you come to church with this kind of desire as opposed to an obligation? <br>
// At times, our flesh can 'long for the courts of the Lord' and other days may not be so.<br>
// Sanctuary is a place where the Lord wants to gather his people and speak to them. <br>
<br>
3 Even the sparrow finds a home,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    and the swallow builds her nest and raises her young<br>
at a place near your altar,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    O Lord of Heaven's Armies, my King and my God!<br>
4 What joy for those who can live in your house,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    always singing your praises. Interlude</p>
5 What joy for those whose strength comes from the Lord,<br>
 <p style="text-indent: 2em;">   who have set their minds on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.</p>
6 When they walk through the Valley of Weeping,<br>
 <p style="text-indent: 2em;">   it will become a place of refreshing springs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">  The autumn rains will clothe it with blessings.</p>
7 They will continue to grow stronger,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    and each of them will appear before God in Jerusalem.</p>
8 O Lord God of Heaven's Armies, hear my prayer.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    Listen, O God of Jacob. Interlude</p>
9 O God, look with favor upon the king, our shield!<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    Show favor to the one you have anointed.</p>
10 A single day in your courts<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    is better than a thousand anywhere else!</p>
I would rather be a gatekeeper in the house of my God<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    than live the good life in the homes of the wicked.</p>
11 For the Lord God is our sun and our shield.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    He gives us grace and glory.</p>
The Lord will withhold no good thing<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    from those who do what is right.</p>
12 O Lord of Heaven's Armies,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    what joy for those who trust in you.</p>

	<b>Psalm 143</b><br>
A psalm of David.<br>
<br>
1 Hear my prayer, O Lord;<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    listen to my plea!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    Answer me because you are faithful and righteous.</p>
<br>   
     // He addressed himself to God in a way that he banks on God's righteousness, not his own. <br>
  <br>   
2 Don't put your servant on trial,<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">    for no one is innocent before you.</p>
  <br>  
    // NO MAN living shall be justified. <br>
    <br>
	<br>
Always have to remind ourselves that anything we do, regardless of how good <br>
it may be, it does not justify us before God. It does not make us holier or<br>
 righteous. It is what HE does for us, not what we do for him. <br>
 <br>
	 "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy <br>
	 rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away."<br>
	  Isaiah 64:6 <br>
	 <br>
	// One that prays and fasts a lot can easily justify themselves, but the word<br>
	 shed light on such a matter.<br>
	<br>
	<h3><b>Why does God permit trails to come into our lives? <br></b></h3>
	<br>
	They more you put your part into becoming a child of God, the harder things tend to become. <br>
	<br>
	We must remind ourselves that we have a very real adversary. They more we want<br>
	to do what is right, the more our adversary will want for us to fall astray. <br>
	<br>
	"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,<br>
	 against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against <br>
	 spiritual wickedness in high places." Ephesians 6:12 <br>
	 <br>
	Trials lead us to become more dependent on Him and may be a reason as to why they are <br>
	permitted.  <br>
	<br>
	We need to be aware that there is price to be paid in seeking Him.<br>
	<br>
	1 Peter 4  // Talks about being put in the furnace. The closer we get to God, the hotter things get. <br>
	<br>
	1 Peter 4:1 
	"So then, since Christ suffered physical pain, you must arm yourselves with the same attitude he had,<br>
	 and be ready to suffer, too. For if you have suffered physically for Christ, you have finished with sin<br>
	 <br>
	// Arm ourselves with what? Suffering of Christ. This reminds us that there are no shortcuts.<br>
	1 Peter 4:15-17<br>
	"If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other <br>
	 people's affairs."
	 <br>
	"But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege <br>
	 of being called by his name!" <br>
	// Suffering as a Christian entails us to be different, standing out. <br>
	 <br>
	 "For the time has come for judgment, and it must begin with God's <br>
	  household. And if judgment begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed <br>
	  God's Good News?"<br>
	  <br>
	// Why does God want judgement to start in the House of God? So we won't be judged on that day<br>
	and since we will judge the world, we will need to be righteous in our judgement. <br>
	<br>
	When someone has a passion for God, you can notice right away. When one falls in<br>
	 ove with someone, all you can think and talk about is that person. In the case of Christ, <br>
	  when we love him, it will be evident to all because they will talk about Him, etc. <br>
	<br>
	When you have a passion for God, if prayer starts at 9:30, you don't arrive at 9:30 or <br>
	10:00, prayer begins when you wake up; you are not merely playing the religious game but rather have<br>
	a true hunger for Christ<br>
	<br>
	When people begin to get cold or indifferent or begin to question God during their <br>
	circumstances, they begin to start walking backwards. They begin to miss one Sunday, <br>
	then an other. Eventually they stray so far that their heart becomes divided. <br>
	<br>
	What is in the heart? Whatever you hold in high regard. <br> 
	<br>
	<h2>1 Peter 4:18 <br>
	 "And also,<br>
	<br>
	If the righteous are barely saved,<br>
    what will happen to godless sinners?"<br></h3>
	<br><b>
	// Scarcely -- this word eliminates the masses of people. <br>
	// This means that believers will need to put on an extraordinarily amount of effort. <br></b>
	<br>
	"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.<br>
	 For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much,<br>
	  of him they will ask the more." Luke 12:48 <br> 
	<br>
	<br>
	Most people want to be on a level with others, but equality does not exist in<br>
	this sense. We can see from the scripture that to those who have been walking<br>
	with the Lord for a longer period, they are to live a more devoted, involved level. <br>
	<br>
	When God's judgement is implored, God does not judge all equally. <br>
	For example, a teacher of God's Word is judged differently and more is expected of them. <br>
	<br>
	When God gives us more, we should most certainly change. <br>
	<br>
	--------- A talk about women<br>
	<br>
	A woman represents the bride, an important role. <br>
	<br>
	Shouldn't you be able to distinguish a believer and nonbeliever? <br>
	One may say "God looks at the heart." <br>
	Yes, he most certainly does. <br>
	<br>
	When women backslide, they often first turn to friends that are not Godly and will <br>
	have noticeable exterior differences. <br>
	<br>
	----------- We are immortal <br>
	<br>
	"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; <br>
	and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<br>
	When the Lord comes, there will be no more death." Revelation 9:6<br>
	<br>
	// When the Lord comes our mortal bodies must put on immorality. There will be no such thing<br>
	as death. <br>
	<br>
	----------- Redeeming the time<br>
	<br>
	"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."  Ephesians 5:16 <br>
	<br>
	Redeeming the time means there is an exchange in activity. If you lost time doing X,Y,Z, then <br>
	that is to be replaced with activity that will draw you closer to the Lord. <br>
	When people "redeem" their time, it means that past time that was wasted must be replaced with <br>
	something different; there must be change. <br>
	<br>
	Are you making an honest effort, or are you just moping around? <br>
	God can not be mocked. <br> 
	Are we asking the Lord for help? <br>
	Do not measure yourself with others around you, and if you have a title of a minister,
	you better minister. <br>
	<br>
	
	----------- SUMMARY <br>
	<br>
	In Summary, Brother Daniel Ibarra brought to our attention how a Christian is to live <br>
	for God. Through the reading and study of Scripture, he was able to bring us God's instruction<br>
	and insight on how we are to live. We see that a Christian is to live...<br>
<br>
	...with a <b>passion</b> for God -- Psalms 84:2<br>
	...with a <b>trust</b> in God -- Psalms 84:12<br>
 	...with <b>humility</b> towards God:<br>
	<p style="text-indent: 2em;">no ones works can justify them -- Psalms 143:2</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 2em;">recognizing that our best isn't nearly enough -- Isaiah 64:6 </p>
	...with an understanding that we will suffer -- 1 Peter 4:15-17<br>
	...<b>>> with a whole <u>lot of effort</u> -- 1 Peter 4:18</b><br>
	...at a level that correspondes to what we have received -- Luke 12:48 <br>
	...(women) differently than the world, including outward appearance -- 1 Timothy 2:9<br>
	...with a remembrance that we are not mortal beings -- Revelation 9:6 <br>
	...in a way that we use our time that we have lost to change into being who God called us to be -- Ephesians 5:16 <br>
	<br>
