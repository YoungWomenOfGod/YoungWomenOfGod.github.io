	<p>What is a Hedge: Barrier<br>
	
	<h2>Q: How to set limits or boundaries in our walk with God. <br></h2>
	<br>
	Why do you go to certain individuals for advice?<br>
	They will tell you what they want you to hear.<br>
	"The truth shall set you free." - John 8:32<br>
	<br>
	When you identify weaknesses, be able to discern them in order to put boundaries in <br>
	our lives to keep us away from our weaknesses. <br>
	<br>
	Story of Job:<br>
	He had everything and the enemy takes it to the point where he has nothing. The enemy <br>
	had an intention of getting him to a bending point. <br>
	Three friends and his wife come to him with responses that were not positive, but blameful. <br>
	Job 1:9<br>
	<br>
	Different Types of Hedges: Self set to protect us from your personal weaknesses, and some that<br>
	God places because he knows how we are each wired.<br>
	<br>
	If your love for God is present, we must put up hedges in our lives to protect us and keep<br>
	us on God's path.<br>
	Ex. In work, make wise choices with free time, who you spend time alone with.<br>
		Make hedges by being accountability with a trusted person, decide how to spend <br>
		your free time, decide that you will not be alone with the opposite sex. <br>
	<br>
	Our goal is to be with the Lord one day and there will be "valleys of deaths."<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Q: How do you know which career path to choose?<br></h2>
	As a man, God has called you to be the head of the home according to God's structure. <br>
	For Bro Saturn, he was stubborn in his vision for his Life. He really wanted to be a cop, like every<br>
	boy. He was dead on on what he did. He didn't seek for advice, nor did he seek God for God's will. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Red flags:</b> Don't seek counsel from parents, experienced professionals in interested field, don't seek God's will. <br>
	<br>
	God chooses different people for different things.<br>
	You can either 	A) Do it your way <br>
					B) Do it God's way // Slow down and do it God's way<br>
	God wants you to be with your family and around godly environments and focus on being a man/woman of God. <br>
	<br>
	Wherever God places you: "Seek first the kingdom of God and His Righteousness." Matthew 6:33<br>
	<br>
	Summary:
	1.Set Boundaries and don't test God's placed boundaries. <br>
	2.Do it God's way; He will show you what to do.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	------------ Bro. Johnny<br>
	<h2><b>Hedges in the work place:</b><br><br>
	1. When you go to interview, be upfront with you faith and which days you will need off. <br>
	2. Find a way to dress modestly<br>
	3. Find a way to attend church services, especially if you don't have the best examples at home<br>
	<br>
	<h2><b>Important Hedges<br></b></h2>
	1. "Choose what is holy over what is unholy" Leviticus 10:1-11 <br>
	Aaron's son presented strange fire and the Lord consumes them with that fire. <br>
	3. Look in your heart to see if there's anything you've gotten from the outside world; cut it off if so. <br>
	  - If your eye causes to sin, pluck it out. <br>
	  Deuteronomy 31 & 32<br> 
	4. Cut ties with ungodly associations at work. // We are to influence, not be influenced. <br>
	5. Be "sober minded" <br>
		- As soon as your emotions are out, it will be hard to become sober minded<br>
	6. Be Humble // "If you are on the ground, nobody can take you down." <br>
	7. Don't let someone outside of the family influence how you think of people inside your family. <br>
	8. If you're a student, read the word before homework. <br>
	9. Need a vision, a purpose to be a Godly person and prepare NOW. <br>
	Proverbs 15:33 "The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility."<br>
	Proverbs 16:1 "The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD."<br>
					- How to know you're humble: If you can close your mouth and only<br>
					let the spiritual out. In order to learn that, you must be sober minded and <br>
					humble. <br>
					- How do you know if what you say is of the Lord:<br>
					When you talk from the heart of the Lord.<br>
					- Stop your tongue and let God speak, as it is a constant battle. <br>
