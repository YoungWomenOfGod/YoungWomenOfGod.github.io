		<h1> Friday December 12, 2014 </h1> 
		<p>Social Media Stats (2012)<br>
500 million/day on FB<br>
2 billion/day youtube<br>
30 billion pieces of content shared/month<br>
110 billion minutes used a day<br>
70% FB, outside of U.S.A<br>
 <br>
Question: Is Social media bad? <br>
Answer: is it good? What is the purpose for it? <br>
I Corinthians 6: 11-12<br>
Lawful: Permitted<br>
Expedient: beneficial, helpful<br>
I Corinthians 10:23<br>
Context: retell Exodus from Egypt, they complained <br>

Deut: 6:5 (talks about daily life)<br>
- doesn't allow for breaks from God, Word ... social media takes that time away<br>
-Joshua 1:8 The book of the law shall never depart<br>
- you don't control social media, it controls you!<br>
-Can't control what people post, you can't delete what you have seen<br>
-social media keeps you from seeing what God has/is doing (it's a distraction, mentally)<br>
-Happens little by little, a trap from devil<br>
<br>
Question: how to deal with technology addiction? <br>
A: Matthew 5:29-30<br>
Mark 9:43-48<br>

Addiction: part of you and life and doesn't let go.   <br>                  We try to justify why it's not an addiction, we don't realize it is
- social media suppresses child of God<br>
<br>
What to do to live as a child of God? <br>
-Pray w/out ceasing<br>
-read the Word of God<br>
-fasting<br>
-fellowship<br>
we know what to do, but not easy w/out Spirit of God<br>
<br>
example: Jacob didn't let go of the angel even when hip was dislocated, his eyes on the blessing not pain. we too, need to latch onto the LORD<br>
<br>
Replace 30 minutes of social media (technology) with prayer or reading or fellowship (w/right people). <br>
<br>
Challenge: <br>
dedicate one full day to the LORD and measure yourself as to how attached/addicted to technology you are.<br>
<br>
<br>
Look for what edifies, not destroys<br>
<br>
Addiction becomes like our eye, hand, feet, we "need" them. We won't be able to cut them off like the word of God <br>
tells us in Matthew or Mark. Addiction tricks us into thinking we need (in this case) technology but we end up valuing it <br>
just like our eye, hand, feet, etc... <br>
cut it off!!!<br>
