<h2>What does it mean to be a child of God?</h2>

---------------------<br>
Bro. Johnny<br>
<br>
<b>// Being born again<br></b>
<br>
Are we born as "Children of God?" NO<br>
<br>
John 1:12 "...gave them power to be children of God"<br>
<br>
Though we come from eternity, we need to be born again. <br>
Not to be confused with: Hebrews 2:7 "Partakers of flesh and blood." <br>
When we come into conception, we still need Salvation. <br>
<br>


--Is everyone a child of God? NO<br>

"Jacob how I loved, and Esau how I hated" <br>

Those who are children of God are chosen, not made. <br>
<br>


<b>// Heart and Mind of Christ<br></b>

Matthew 13 "finds a treasure and sells everything he has, to get the treasure. " <br>
	- Sell everything we have, dump it all to go after the treasure <br>
	- "Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, and mind."<br>
	It means he wants us to be women of God, and men of God.<br>
	- 1 Peter "Chosen Generation Royal Preist hood a pacicular people."<br>
"Who is the real Jew?" - Romans: <br>

How do you know if a tree bears good fruit? <br>
Try it! <br>

Being a child of God is what we produce. (Galatians 5)<br>
Where does our fruit come from? Heart <br>

The Lord condemned the Religious people of that day because the motives of their hearts were not in the right place. <br>
<br>
"Why do your disciples pick fruit on Sabbath?" <br>
<br>

Having the Mind(heart)of Christ:<br>
If you are a child of God, you have a mind of Christ, otherwise you are not a child of God. <br>
You're either a child of God or a child of the Devil  (1 John 3:10, John 8:44)<br>
<br>
We must go against the flesh by having the Mind of Christ. <br>
- Romans 11<br>
- Philippians 2<br>
- 1 Corinthians 6<br>
<br>
The power of the mind: ( E.V. I)<br>
	"How come the children of the Devil make a better effort to worship the devil than children<br>
	of God?" (Fast, worship, radical practices)<br>
	"But the children of God can't overcome their flesh."<br>
<br>	
If we don't have the mind of Christ, we can NOT be children of God. If we do, we should be confident that we are God's children. <br>
<br>
How many people do things they shouldn't do and justify that "it's okay" for five minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nutshell: Allowing the mind of God to be in our minds to overpower us. <br>
Your first reaction is your measuring stick to whether you have the mind of Christ or not. <br>
<br>
"It is God who gives us the will and power to do.." Philippians <br>
"If someone wants you to walk a mile, walk an extra mile." Matthew 6: // God will give us the energy <br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
Bro. Saturn<br>
<br>
Our physical features emulate our parents, as should our behaviors emulate our heavenly father's.<br>
<br>
Fruits of the Spirit are a reflection of who God is. If we do not reflect that,<br>
reading, prayer, actively pursue to be like minded to have the mind of Christ how<br>
can we be called a Son of God? <br>
<br>
John 1:12 "But as many as...."<br>
Galatians 3:26 "<br>
Romans 7:22 "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Law of my Mind: "that casts aside every imagination.."<br>
- Devil will try and test your mind (i.e.Job)<br>
- Constant war until this captivity(of our flesh) will be over. <br>
Romans 8:17 // Don't worry what you're going through, it WILL be worth it. <br>
Luke 11:11 // "Will he give him  stone?, etc." <br>
<br>
In all areas, God went through the same struggles, but had no sin. <br>
God is asking for us to give our lives because it is something he has done already. <br>
<br>
>> How to plan , minister to others, and many other questions are byproducts of us mirroring Him. <br>
	- "Seek first the Kindgom of God."Matthew 6:33 <br>
Thank God for the blessings, and for the challenges. <br>
<br>
If I want results, it takes hard work and it is a process.<br>
You have to have a commitment regardless of how you feel, it is when you push through the limits. <br>
<br>

How do you know you are called? "Sheeps hear his voice." <br>
"Faithful is he who started a good work in your life."<br>
