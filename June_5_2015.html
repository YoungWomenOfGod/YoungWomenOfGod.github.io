		Fruit of the Spirit <br>
		When we have concerns several areas and situations, the fruit of the Spirt is the answer. <br>
		We will know how to respond <br>
		<br>
		Galatians 5:22-23<br>
		<br>
		<b>Gentleness: </b><br>
		Meek - Prades <br>
		Meek and Gentle are very similar. <br>
		Matthew 5:5 "Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth"<br>

		When you think of the word meek, one may think of "weak;" It may seem that <br>
		one can easily walk all over. <br> 
		When in reality, there is strength in restraint. <br>
		<br>
		Take the example of the wild stallion. A stallion that is untamed and rampet.<br>
		Once this stallion  is tamed he becomes more util, but his power remains.<br>
		<br>
		Similarly, when  gentleness is used, we will be more useful; we will have more power.  <br>
		<br>
		Usually we think that the powerful will be the once to inherit the earth, but God says otherwise. <br>
		<br>
		Proverbs 15:1 "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."<br>
		<br>
		We automatically respond to someone else's tone. <br>
		Concerns about dealing with siblings and others can be address with <br>
		a meek, gentle, restrained response. <br>
		<br>
		1 Corinthians 4:13<br>
		"Being defamed, we entreat. We have been made as filth of thr world, <br>
		the offscouring of all things until now." <br>
		<br>
		Our immediate recation to people speaking negatively of us, we often respond elevately. <br> 
		In the moment when people say something, especially if you know it's not true, just RELAX. <br>
		Who do we think we are to demand respect 24 /7 <br>
		"Who is man that though are mindful of us"<br>
		<br>
		Titus 2:8 "Sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an <br>
		opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you."<br>
		<br>
		When someone is rasing a false testimony about you to someone who knows you well, the person <br>
		listening will know that they are speaking lies. <br>
		
		2 Timothy 2:25 "In meekness correcting those who are in opposition, <br>
		if God perhaps will grant them repentence, so that they may know the truth"<br>
		<br>
		Correction is done in meekness, not in a condemning fashion. Meekness is going to the 
		person with Christ's love. <br>
		If someone comes to you in opposition to your belief system, don't argue with them. <br>
		<br>
