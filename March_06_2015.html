	<h2>Family related questions:<br>
	How can I be a blessing to my siblings?<br>
	How can we honor our parents?<br></h2>
	<br>
	Answer: Humility.<br>
	<br>
	Without humility we find ourselves having pride and selfishness. If we are not humble we will<br>
	not be willing to be the sibling God has called us to be or the son or daughter that we are. <br>
	<br>
	"Let nothing be nothing be done through strife and vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each <br>
	esteem others better than themselves." Philipians 2:3<br>
	<br>
	Look for what needs to be done, not just your own agenda. Look for ways you can be <br>
	a blessing to others. A person that can serve "The son of Man came not to be served, but to serve." [Matthew 20:28]<br>
	If this was the Lord's disposition, do we have really have wiggle room in this arena of life?<br>
	<br>
	"Put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,<br>
	 humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering. "Colossians 3:12<br>
	Is it easy to forgive one another? <br>
	<br>
	"Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;" <br>
	<br>
	In order to live in this manner of forgiveness, humility needs to be present.<br>
	Some people are professional at putting on a <br>
	front, but if you are not showing fruits at home as a husband/wife, <br>
	son/daughter, sibilings, etc.  it counts for nothing. <br>
	<br>
	Having the mind of Christ allows us to overcome characteristics of our natural state (pride, selfishness, anger, etc.) .<br>
	
	<b>When is the right to be humble?</b><br>
	 No! Do not wait until the Lord uses a hardship to sound the alarm. The Lord knows how to <br>
	 bring us to our kness and will do so if you are His child for the sake of your salvation<br>
	<br>
	<b><br><h3>Story of Moses: </b><br></h3>
	<br>
	He was raised as an Egyptian and if one reads between the lines, one can pick up a hint of arrogance found in his<br>
	days spent in Egypt.<br> Given that he was an Israelite, as a leader, he was in a position of power and wanted <br>
	to take manners into his own hands. If someone was putting your family or heritage in harms way or bringing social <br>
	oppression to your interested party and you happened to be in a position of authority, would you not also want to <br>
	take matters into your hands? One can pick up the pride that was in Moses when he put to death and Egyptians <br>
	life for harassing an Israelite. <br>
	<br>
	In order to humble Moses, God had to take all of his luxuries and sent him off away from Egypt. <br>
	As a shepherd (Exodus 2) and delivering a group of women, he proved his new found humility to the Lord. <br>
	He was in a monotonous lifestyle as a shepherd. On an ordinary day, he sees the burning bush. He sees that he has<br>
	ample humility and a change in character; it was then when he appeared before Moses in the form of a burning <br>
	bush and was given instruction to deliver the nation of Israel. The Lord knew what Moses needed in order for him come <br>
	to a place of humility. After Moses arrived to that place of humility, the Lord brought to his agenda into fruition, but not <br>
	until he saw that Moses was reverent (Exodus 3 as he stands in front of the bush) and humble (tending sheep) that this <br>
	supernatural, historical, life changing event would happen. <br>
	
	<b><h3>Story of David: <br></b></h3>
	<br>
	Was given a coat of many colors by His father as his father's favorite son. <br>
	He begins to cry out in the den which shows his dependency on God and not his father. <br>
	In order to deny temptation around him, he must have had some level of God in him. <br>
	In every position of the way, he remained humble. <br>
	<br>
	We are all going to go through different chapters in our lives. Sometimes we suffer deeply, and all paths <br>
	lead us to where we need to be to be humble. <br>
	<br>
	By us staying level to the ground, that is when the Lord can give us Honor where Honor is due. <br>
	<br>
	James 3:13-18 <br>
	"13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works<br>
	 with meekness of wisdom. <br>
<br>
14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.<br>
>> If you have this, you will live in a cloud of confusion on a continue basis.<br>
<br>
15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.<br>
<br>
16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<br>
<br>
17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full <br>
of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br>
	Peaceable // Security in heart, it calms insecurity. <br>
	Willing to Yield // Our human nature can be cut throat. It is difficult to bite the tongue <br>
	Good fruits // Fruits of the Spirit. Someone can portray the aforementioned, but you can not fake fruits of the Spirit. <br>
				// If your fruits are not there, it doesn't matter what you say. <br>
	If you can't give God full control, it's when you trust God completely that you see Him work in your life. <br>
	<br>
<br>
18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace." <br>
	<br>
	Being an open book, not having a hidden agenda, and being sincere<br>

	Which ever area the Lord puts you in, you will gladly do it, because you are humble. <br>
	As long as you're willing and show you are humble, God will use you. <br>
	<br>
	God has called us each to do something in our lives and only the Lord knows what that is. <br>
	<br>
	<h2>//Women's Career <br></h2>
	After 13 years of Sister Katie working as an Christian school educator, she began to search<br>
	for God's direction and came to a conclusion. She was to:  <br>
	
	-- Be a crown of glory to her husband <br>
	-- Instruct her children. <br>
	
	Though she was an instrument for other children's lives, her time had come to realize that<br>
	she wanted to "seek first the kingdom of God" and became open the Lord's calling in this <br>
	area of her life." <br>
	<br>
	<h2>// Knowing if they are "the one"<br></h2>
	-- Seek counsel  <br>
	-- Seek your parents blessing, your pastor's blessing, your spiritual leader's blessing.<br>
	 (In the multitude of counselors there is safety... Proverbs 11:14)<br>

	--------------- Bro. Johnny <br>
	<br>
	It is important to study the Word of God, seek knowledge that is present in scripture.  <br>
	<br>
	Colossians 3:13 <br>
	Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any:<br>
	 even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<br>
	<br>
	Some of us are arrogant in that when we are in a conflict, we will not forgive someone<br>
	 until their forgiveness is "good" enough for us. <br>
	If someone offends us, we wait for them to apologize and not believe they are being sincere. <br>
		-- this is being arrogant <br>
	<br>
	<h3>
	<b>How did the Lord forgive us? <br>
	Were we there 2,000 years to ask for forgiveness? <br>
	When did he forgive us? <br></b>
	</h3>
	Did he forgive us before we asked him for forgiveness or did he wait for us to ask him? <br>
	<br>
	Learn from me "I am meek and humble." <br>
	<br>
	How many of us have gotten into fights, been disrespectful to elders? <br>
	The Lord forgave us, but how many of us have asked for forgiveness?<br>
	He forgave us before we even asked for forgiveness. <br>
	The harder an offense is, the harder it is to forgive someone.<br>
	<br>
	Humility, though, is a style of living. If we do not forgive, we are the selfish ones. <br>

	If your spiritual mentality is up to par (only you know), if something happens, we immediately ask God why. <br>
	<br>
	Tell the Lord, "Let your will be done" when things are bad, not just good. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Did God speak to the people before the Idol was built? <br></b>
	Yes, in chapter 19 in the giving of the ten commandments. <br>
	In chapter 31, they were fearful of the Lord. Although they were told not to make an idol, they still did. <br>
	<br> 
	We all lack humility, even the most humble person will not say they are humble. <br>	
	
	>> Seek what it means to be humble in your life right now and act on what you have heard. <br>
	<br>
	<h3><b>How do we begin to humble ourselves? </b></h3>// a key to inheriting eternal life. <br>
	>> Prayer first and then with others. <br>
	Be truthful with the Lord.<br>
