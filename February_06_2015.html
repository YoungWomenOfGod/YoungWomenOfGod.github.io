Q: How to be ready for opposition? How to to talk about our faith to homosexuals, Muslims, agnostics, etc...<br>
<br>
A: (Saturn)<br>
<br>
Proverbs 1:7<br>
-"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge:<br>
but fools despise wisdom and instruction."<br>
- it will give us confidence<br>
<br>
Matthew 10:28<br>
- "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul:but rather <br>
fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."<br>
- don't fear what can/will happen to our physical being<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:26<br>
- "In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence:<br>
and his children shall have a place of refuge."<br>
- we'll have strong confidence in what we believe, our faith, in the Word of God.<br>
<br>
Fear the LORD, not what people will say/think about you.<br>
<br>
Take a stand for the things of God with conviction, without being rude (use scripture)<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 12:13<br>
- "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:Fear God, and keep his commandments:<br>
for this is the whole duty of man."<br>
<br>
Our actions (the manner we live) can speak louder than our words.<br>
<br>
1 John 4:18<br>
- "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:because fear hath torment.<br>
 He that feareth is not made perfect in love."<br>
<br>
If our intentions are to put people down/in their place (to be confrontational), then keep your mouth shut.<br>
 You won't honor GOD with a spirit of pride.<br>
<br>
A: (Johnny)<br>
<br>
Mathew 16:22-23<br>
- "Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord:<br>
this shall not be unto thee. But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:<br>
thou art an offence unto me:for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."<br>
- rebuked mentality/spirit not Peter<br>
<br>
How to combat a lie? With the truth.<br>
<br>
Fear the LORD!<br>
- Hebrews 10:31, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."<br>
- not just an intellectual fear, but also an actual trebling fear.<br>
<br>
Homosexuals and others don't know we are against their mentality. That's what we rebuke, not the actual person.<br>
<br>
When others "reject" us, it's really the LORD and His Word they are rejecting.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2:14<br>
- "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:for they are foolishness unto him:<br>
neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."<br>
<br>
Those that reject are "dignos de lastima" (worthy of compassion).<br>
- we must speak to others with love<br>
- "Love thy neighbor," refers to not just physical next-door neighbor but to everyone <br>
in the world all around us (at school, work, store. Etc.)<br>
<br>
Don't look down on people<br>
-ex: Bro. Ephraim Sr. spoke with compassion to those who didn't know the LORD.<br>
<br>
The Word of God is Spirit and goes into our minds.<br>
