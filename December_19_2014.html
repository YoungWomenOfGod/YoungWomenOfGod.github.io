		Assimilate: Go with the crowd, blend in with an environment.<br>
Assimilation happens when you do not have wisdom.<br>
<br>
Main focus: What are the Godly characteristics, virtues and qualities that will
 both answer and fill the need for every concern both present and future. <br>
<br>
<h3> Social Media Recap </h3>
&quot;All things are lawful, but not beneficial&quot; 1 Corinthians 6:11-12<br>
Lawful: Legal<br>
<br>
&quot;If your eye, hand, foot causes you or someone else to stumble, cast if off.&quot; <br>
Eye: People you see<br>
Hand: Things you do<br>
Foot: Places you go.<br>
<br>
Some people, things, and places become so attached, that they seem as vital as an eye,
 foot or hand. Not physically, of course, but as things that become a part of our lives. <br>
<br>
If someone were to ask you to cut off your eye, hand, or foot would you consent? Absolutely not,<br>
right? The only time we cut it off, is when there is cancer or some sort of illness. When it comes<br>
down to making such a medical decision before the illness has spread, it is either your eye, hand, or foot <br>
or your whole body will be affected. Similarly, if your hand is going to cause spiritual destruction,<br>
then it is best to cut off entirely before it spreads.<br>
<br>
<b>THREE CHECK POINTS: </b>
Just because something is not bad, or is legal, doesn’t mean it is beneficial.<br>
Check one: Is it lawful? <br>
Check two: Is it beneficial to my ultimate goals, who I am now or who I want to become?<br>
Check three: I will not allow myself to become controlled by these things (Exercise self disciple).<br>
<br>
Ex: College student is going to take three classes, two have nothing to do with your major.<br> 
 Is it a good class?<br>
Are they going to help me reach my goal?<br>
This will be a deal breaker.<br>
	- I will control myself and not take them because I know they do not align with my educational plan.<br>
<br>
Most people don’t reach goals because they do what they WANT to do versus what they NEED to do. The same is true <br>
with our spiritual walk with God. We need to do what we need, not what we want by looking at the three check points:<br>
 Is it lawful, is it beneficial, if not, I will exercise self discipline. <br>
<br>
<b>Q: Is social bad?<br>
A: Is it easy for it to take over time? If we don’t use our mind before we get involved, we will not be able to control it. </b>
<br>
&quot;Cast off&quot; in greek means to thrust it off with force, not passively because you understand it will do you no good. <br>
<br>
We need to bring it before God for direction where we should go, what we should see, what we should do. <br>
<br>
Do not ignore the doubt that arises, as it is God&apos;s spirit moving in you to bring it to prayer. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Reasons to have Bible study at home: </b><br>
To build relationship with God, parents and siblings.<br>
<br>
Family relationships are delicate, but very important. Be intentional about these relationships.<br>
 Do not let time draw a huge gap between you and do not let a catastrophic circumstance to be the reason that brings you together. <br>
<br>
If one area in your life is not functional, then an other area will become dysfunctional. When you have deficiencies, <br>
it will effect us; it will start to nag on you. <br>
<br>
If a Friday comes around and nothing is going on at church, initiate a study at home. <br>
We need to take care of our siblings (provoke positive emotions), of what God has given us, and not take them lightly.<br>
 Seek to make the best out of situations that we are in, whatever they may be.<br>
<br>
Most problems stem from family issues. These issues will either make you or break you as a person. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3> How to be consistent with prayer and reading? </h3><br>
<br>
Understand that this is your bread and your water. <br>
	 John 6:63 &quot;The words I have are spirit and are life...&quot;<br>
	 Matt 4:4  &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone...&quot;<br>
<br>
Almost all sickness come from your gut. // From an unbalanced bacteria <br>
How does food get to stomach? Nose and mouth (Oxygen and nutrients)<br>
What is your spiritual stomach? Your mind.<br>
What is its entry point: Eyes and ears.<br>
<br>
Everything that goes into your stomach is decided before hand. <br>
If you eat food body is not made to digest, after a while all the waste gets plastered around the intestines walls.<br>
<br>
What you see and hear is going to affect your life (how you feel, what you speak, how you behave) just as what you eat and breathe affects your body. <br>
 <br>
If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out because they will effect you negatively. If we are seeing and hearing junk what can we except<br>
 of our attitude and behavior of our actions?<br>
<br>

<h3>Music</h3>
<br>
A lot of people are under the power of worldly music. In other words, they have no control of their listening to it. Music is spirit,
 words are spirit, you can not see them. You can see the instrument, but not the tune. <br>
<br>
Ezekiel: Music was created for two purposes: Worship God and stimulate others to worship God, not personal entertainment. <br>
<br>
&quot;Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;&quot; Ephesians 5:19<br>
<br>	

Any music that does not move you to draw closer to God, should not be listened to. <br>
<br>
Lucifer was made with an instrumental body; instruments were built into his body.<br>
 Every time he moved and he opened his eyes, there was music. <br>

The enemy takes everything that was made for God and twists it. People have done the same and made it for their<br>
 pleasure instead. Satan took what was meant to worship God to try and be like God. When we take things that<br>
  God made for him for ourselves, we are following Satan&apos;s footsteps. <br>
<br>
A lot of musicians are living against God&apos;s word. You listening to them, you are being inspired by wicked hearts; <br>
things that are corrupt; things that are against God’s word. By listening to these, you are robbing God&apos;s glory. <br>
Words that are not from inspiration from God are death; like junk food, but for your ears. <br>
<br>
Spiritual Hymns: Touch your spirit and connect your to God, everything else appeases the flesh, for YOUR own <br>
pleasure, just like what Satan did. <br>
<br>
What to do? Cut it off. If you can not let go, it is a sign that you have been taken under its power. <br>
It hurts because it has become a part of your life, like and an arm, foot, eye. <br>
<br>
What is your goal? What are you going for? Are you living for a purpose to be ready for the coming of the Lord. <br>
<br>
We need to stay healthy by:<br>
Stop eating whats bad<br>
Start eating what is good (The good flushes out the bad).<br>
<br>
If you have both, they cancel out. <br>
<br>
Measure for all music:<br>
Is the music connecting me to God, does it motivate me to worship God, does it make you think about God?<br>
<br>
God does not want to work with perfect people. He wants to work with people who know they have issues and want to change.<br>
<br>
We need to make choices: Are we going to chose that which is beneficial which will strengthen our mind?<br>
